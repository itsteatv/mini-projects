# Mini Projects Repository

Welcome to my Mini Projects Repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small frontend projects that I've developed while exploring new technologies and learning experiences. These mini projects are designed to be quick, focused, and serve as hands-on exercises to deepen my understanding of various concepts and tools.

### Why Mini Projects?

These mini projects serve as a playground for experimenting with new technologies and concepts, especially when time is limited. They are an excellent way to reinforce learning without the commitment of a large, complex project. Each project typically revolves around ReactJS, incorporates a touch of TypeScript, utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, and may include other useful libraries when needed.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code quality and development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building designs.

## How to Run

For each project, follow the specific instructions in their respective README files to set up and run the application.
